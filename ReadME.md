This is my First React Project
Concepts Covered
-React Components
-Conditional Rendering
-State and Props
-UseEffect Hook
-Controlled Inputs
-Event Listeners

It's a Quiz App using an API
I would be using Tailwind, Vite and React Develop It.

Storing the results of fetch requests effectively seems to be posing a Challenge -Fixed with Use State

-Populating the Quiz Page

Extra Credit
-Catch Error of Fetching QUIZ and alert User
-I can Probably promote some of the states , but that would be later, for now this MVP is enough
-Need to Fix the issue of all Buttons being Disabled instead of only the wrong Answers
-Validation to Ensure all 5 answers have been Selected(Although this doesnt seem to affect user Experience)

Key Features
-Visual Aid for Option Selection
-Visual Aid for Right Answers
-Total Number of Correct Answers
-Restart Quiz
